# Your Final Thesis Project

## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

**This is a solo project** to show off what you've learned during your time at GA!

Make sure you review your project proposal with your pod leader so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

## Technical Requirements
**Your app must:**

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Have a database**. This will more than likely be postgres, and it should contain sufficiently complex tables and associations.
* **Have a JSON api backend**. This could be Express or Flask.
* **Have an interactive front-end**. This will more than likely be React.
* **Be a complete product**. Hint: this probably includes CRUD functionality.
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible

## Proposals

Your proposal is due Friday 5/21. Make two repos, one for your frontend and one for your backend. Put your proposal in your `README.md` _of your frontend repo_.

Your proposal must include:
- The name of your app.
- What your MVP looks like.
- What your stretch goals are.
- User stories that describe how your app will be used.
- Wireframes!
- Frontend component diagram!
- Database diagrams!
- http routes inventory!
- What technologies you intend on using.
- Your completion timeline: what you expect to get done by when
- Foreseen challenges or obstacles.
- A link to your repo! 

### Timeline 

- **5/21**: Proposals are due to your pod leader
- **5/26**: Deployment jams! (Separate jams for express backends, flask backends, and react frontends.) Aim to be done with your MVP by this date. 
- **5/28**: Project presentations and graduation!

### What if I Have a Dream That Doesn't Fulfill the Requirements?

If you have an idea that might not fulfill the above requirements, that's ok.  This is your project and you should feel like you have absolute ownership over it.  However, if you deviate from the requirements (which are pretty lax) you will be required to have a "Shark Tank" style meeting with your pod leader with a detailed proposal. Your proposal should cover all the requirements of a normal proposal, but you should also be prepared to explain:

* **Why is your project better for your portfolio than the current specs?**
* **If you are not using React** demonstrate to us that you are already an React expert and doing a final project in React would be extraneous.
* **That your idea is really cool and indisputably impressive.**

## Necessary Deliverables


* A **working front-end**, hosted on heroku
* A **frontend repo** on github. The readme should include your design documents from the proposal phase, a link to your backend repo, and a link to both deployments.
* A **working back-end**, hosted on heroku
* A **backend repo** on github. The readme doesn't have to duplicate the frontend readme, but it should contain a link to the frontend repo and both deployments.
* **Frequent commits** in both repos


## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're only making one app. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Random Fun Things You Could Check Out (Definitely not required):
* React Native - Use React to build a phone app!
* Electron - Use JS to build a native application
* Raspberry Pi - Use JS to build a robot/IoT project
* D3 - Build beautiful graphs and visual experiences for data.

## Project Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, and/or task tracking as specified above?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?
